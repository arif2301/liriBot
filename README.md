# liriBot

## Purpose 
This project is called LiriBot. It will take in 3 commands to either search for a movie, a song or a concert by an artist of your choice. it will run on GitBash or on a terminal on visual studio.

## Background on the code
The application is written in JavaScript. The first are declaring all the variables and required files. Then we have a series of functions to decipher input and provide the necessary output.


## Instruction
To Start, direct your terminal to the liriBot folder. Key in 'npm i', so all necessary JS files are downloaded.
